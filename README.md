# SNHU CS 250 Final Project Reflection

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Correctly interpretting user needs is essential for a software developer to understand the problem that they need to solve before rushing into code. Misinterpretting the user needs can lead to creating software that does not provide the correct value to address the user needs. User stories are an approach to outlining the value that a feature of a software should provide the user. Through understanding the acceptance criteria of a user story, the developer can determine what the definition of done is for a given feature. 

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Processes that I hope to incorporate into my future development work would be a planning phase. By incorporating a planning phase, I will be able to set a timeframe and goals to be completed by the end of the timeframe. This will allow me to stay focused on the objectives that I have placed for myself and I will be able to track my progress. Another process that I can implement at the end of the timeframe that I have set for myself can also be a self reflection phase to revaluate if I have achieve the goals I intended to achieve and what improvement I can make in the future. Being a good team member 

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means being able to collaborate effectively with others and contribute to the team's goals. As a software developer, you are a technical individual who should also be able to communicate concepts to less technical team members.
